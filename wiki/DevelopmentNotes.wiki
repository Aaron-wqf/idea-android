#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Development Notes =

== Short-Term Tasks ==

  * "Create New Activity" action
  * Proper make support (ValidityState) for aapt, aidl and dex
  * Complete code insight for manifests
  * "Deploy on make" option (to avoid emulator restart when restarting app)
  * Select activity to run in run configuration settings
  * Select emulator startup options in run configuration settings
  * Auto-add android.jar to module dependencies
  * Quickfix to regenerate R.java for unresolved resource references

== Longer-Term Tasks ==

  * Debug support
  * Code insight for view definition files
  * Application level configurable for SDK paths

== Maybe Someday Tasks ==

  * Complete implementation of AIDL language
  * i18n actions to move string literals to resource files
  
== Problems ==

  * Android SDK location is an application scope setting (local) which is currently stored in .iml files (shared). Should have application-level configurable with mapping from SDK version to installation path, and store only SDK version in .iml

  * Completion of tag and attribute names in .xml files is not available because schema is not available for Android XML formats, and DOM-based tag/attribute name completion seems to be available only in post-7.0 IntelliJ IDEA versions.

  * Spurious "cannot find definition" highlighting in Android XML files.
